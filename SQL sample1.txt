MySQL is a database management system.
 A database is a structured collection of data


MySQL databases are relational.
 A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big storeroom. The database structures are organized into physical files optimized for speed.
 
The SQL part of “MySQL” stands for “Structured Query Language”. SQL is the most common standardized language used to access databases.

MySQL software is Open Source.
Open Source means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify the software. Anybody can download the MySQL software from the Internet and use it without paying anything.

SQL Data Types
SQL supports a series of data types to be used with it, among which we have to choose depending on the requirements of our projects. Those are:

 Numeric Data Types
 Date and Time Data Types

 In SQL, a foreign key is used to link two tables together.

To achieve this, we match either a column or a combination of columns whose values to a primary key in another table.
