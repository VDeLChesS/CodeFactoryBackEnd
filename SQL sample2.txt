CREATE DATABASE my_database_name DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;

This will create a database with the name my_database_name. The default character set is utf-8, something you might be familiar with from the Frontend Web Developer course.



CREATE TABLE new_table(
columnA datatype,
columnB datatype,
columnC datatype,
..... columnN datatype,
PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns ));

This will create a table named new_table, within which we declare a number of columns along with the datatype we want them to store.

The statement PRIMARY KEY is used here to assign a primary key to one or more columns (we will learn what this means and why we mostly assign it to one column in a minute).
