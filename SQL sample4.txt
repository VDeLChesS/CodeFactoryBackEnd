// a faster way of doing it would be:
INSERT INTO INVENTORS

Using the ORDER BY clause, you can sort the data selected in ascending or descending order, based on one or more columns.

As you will expect, the SQL DELETE statement will delete the selected records from a table. You can also use the WHERE clause here to specify which elements to delete. If you do not, ALL the records will be deleted.

The TRUNCATE statement will delete the data inside a table/database but will keep the structure of the table/database.
